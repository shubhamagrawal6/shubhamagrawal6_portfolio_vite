  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
  

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

1. Install the dev dependency (only needed once):

  npm install --save-dev gh-pages

2. Build and deploy:

  npm run deploy

This will build the app into the `build` folder and publish it to the `gh-pages` branch. In your GitHub repository settings (Pages), set the source to the `gh-pages` branch if it isn't set automatically. The site will be available at: `https://shubhamagrawal6.github.io/shubhamagrawal6_portfolio_vite/`
